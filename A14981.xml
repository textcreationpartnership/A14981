            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For in deede the cleane contrarie is rather vpon the premiſſes to be gathered: as in this ſorte. The Catholique ſaith, by Church prelacie, &amp; commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of lawes, is paſſing politicke, &amp; beneficiall euen to the wordlie good of Princes, and Subiectes: Therfore it is no humane deuiſe, but a diuine inſtitution.

VVhich aſſuredlie is the verie purpoſe of diuine prouidence, coueting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to vnite man vnto the prime cauſe, from which he hath iſhewe and progenie.</p>

And for that naturally nothing is more odious then hereſie, the harme therof is like to fall on thoſe, who afford patronage thereunto. VVherfore ſuch Princes as deſire to bring to paſſe rare and eminent exploites, or haue a care dying in the bed of honour, to liue after by fame with poſteritie (the profeſſion of the Romane Catholique faith to ſuch grand deſignes and purpoſes being only of moment, in compariſon of all other beleefes beſides) oughte to entertaine the ſame with noble &amp; princely minds, as a thing of chiefe importance and neceſſitie to be by them regarded and maintained.</p>

                  </gap>ſition the law of faith, and that of the Ghoſpell, from the lawe of workes, and naturall integritie of behauiour</p>
               <p>11, Some times the holy Apoſtle by ſtile of the law ſignifieth the ceremoniall law, properly belonging to the Ieue, which by faith and grace of the Ghoſpell was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and determine: at other times by title of the law he compriſeth the entire tenor of the ſame, purporting morall life, in as much as it doeth not include the ſpirit of chriſtian faith, but onely as it lieth ingraued in the hard and dead tables of ſtone, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from faith in Chriſt, ſeruing merely to inſtruct, and to afright man his frailtie or rebellious diſpoſition by feare of puniſhement aſſigned therin to tranſgreſſors. But in deede, faith, grace, &amp; the Ghoſpell doe containe in their bouels as it were the ſelfe ſame naturall law of workes, and probitie: which by reaſon of an inward burning cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, more effectually and induſtriouſly doeth execute them, then the morall docume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntes of vertues of themſelues deliuered by almightie God vnto the Ieues, and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in ſtonie tables, were able to performe. So that the proper ſpirit of faith, of grace and of the Ghoſpell, is a ſpirit of Godd workes, and in this kinde more operatiue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer was the lawe of Moyſes. VVhereupon then aſſuredly doth a Chriſtian man, not a Ieue, as teacheth S. Auguſtin, behaue himſelfe according to the ſpirit of faith, Grace and the Ghoſpell, when by vertuous endeuours he is moſte obedient, &amp; humble; when he is eminentlie chaſt, and mortifieth the fleſh by rigorous diſcipline of life: when he faſteth, prayeth, giueth almes, helpeth his neighbours, payeth what he oweth. In which endeuors he is not a Ieue, or a follower of the lawe, as Turchiſhly and barbatou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly proteſtantes doe teache, but rather a perfect Chriſtian, ſhining in the grace and light of the Ghoſpell according to S Auguſtin. Good God, can naturall honeſtie of good workes be eſtranged from faith &amp; freedome of the Ghoſpell? Is a Ieue, or a bare philoſopher, by inſtinct of doctrine, an honeſter man, a man of greater perfection, which conſiſteth in good action, then is a proteſtant profeſſing the libertie of the Ghoſpell? when almightie God is to iudge all Chriſtians at the latter daie, he is to iudge them by their faith, their grace, and libertie of the Ghoſpell: yet by vertue therof, and their one vocation, as workemen, as ſouldiers, pilgrimes, huſbandmen: in whom the ſpirit of faith, of grace, and of the Ghoſpell is intrinſically and eſſentially operatiue, allotted to taske of labour &amp; ſweate in vertue: from whoſe eſtate and faith are not to be diſtinguiſhed their trauailes, as the Ghoſpell is ſeuered from the law. <hi>Call the vvorkemen,</hi> ſaieth our ſauiour Chriſt, <hi>and geue them their revvarde</hi> Then Chriſtians by nature and proper conducte of faith, of grace and of the Ghoſpell are obſeruers of the law. <hi>He that ſovveth ſparinglie shall reape ſparinglie.</hi> And when ſondrie places of holy ſcriptures exhorte vs to workes of vertue, doubtles we are ſpoken vnto as Chriſtians, by faith, grace, and Ghoſpell ordained to worke, and that more efficaciouſlie then ether Ieues by meanes of their law, or Gentill by force of his philoſophie, could be inabled.</p>

VVherefore, as the Theologicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Hope adorneth man his will beinge <hi>Iraſcible,</hi> apointed to ouercome difficultie of enterpriſe, ſo doeth it much rely on fortitude, placed in the ſame facultie, fencing and garding hope from fall of diſloialtie againſt almightie God.

To the which effect alſo the Apoſtle S.

And to this purpoſe dooth he expounde S. Iames: <hi>That vvhich is donne in ſight againſt concupiſcence, is donne that concupiſcence doe not bring ſortb ſinne.</hi> And if at any time this naturall concupiſcence be called by S. Auguſtine ſinne, he meaneth it to be ſinne firſt as effect of ſinne, and a vicioſitie of nature, then as an allurement to ſinne, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlie as the obiect of ſinne, for that an obiect bad and contrarie to vertue and right iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement: laſtlie as the materiall part of originall ſinne, and ſo it is likewiſe tearmed by Saint Thomas. The reaſon alſo of this is manifeſt; for that theſe motions, althoughe<note place="margin">D. Thom. 1. 2. q. 82. ar. 1. 2 3. 4.</note> they be the actions of a man, as vitallie and effectiuelie proceeding from the faculties of his ſoule, yet they be not actions humane, that is freee ones, and conſiderate, but ruſhe and breake out of nature, as they doe in bruite beaſtes by impetuoſitie of the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le diſtempered; as it falleth out in ſleepe and phrenſie: And ſo it is impoſſible with iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement to eſteeme of them as of actuall ſinnes, and culpable miſdemeanures of man, he being not of abilitie to auoyde them, yet labouring againſt them what he may throughe the grace of Chriſt. For moſte abſure it is to place ſinne in that motion, which hath no freedome of worke in it, but is rather meerlie naturall and neceſſarie, as it falleth out in the firſt motions of concupiſcence.

If ſo, then is Hope in vs greatlie increaſed reſpectiuelie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo deere and bountifull a protectour Chriſt our Sauiour. Contrariwiſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtanter impeacheth the gift, weakeneth the defence, auouching the iuſt actuallie to committ by a continuall diſorder of workes a million of mortall and deadlie ſinnes, flowing and guſhing ſtill oute of concupiſcence, to the violation of all the tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and thereby ſuch iuſt perſons to be formallie and reallie polluted, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and worthie in fact and demerit of eternall fier in hell.

Heere certes is Antichriſt defacing the maieſtie of Chriſt with diſhonour, impairing his abilitie with penurie, auiling his liberalitie with nigardiſe, and placing Chriſt with a raine bow of a phantaſticall iuſtice vnder Sathan, domineering and tyranniſing vpon the ſoules of men with the excrements of all offences, and filth of forbidden concupiſcence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea this vile hereſie raiſeth it ſelf to the verie miſpriſon of God his eternall and iuſt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.<note place="margin">The Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is hereticall againſt the prouidence of God.</note> For if concupiſcence be a deadlie ſinne, then is it to be puniſhed, it remayning as due cauſe and procurement thereof; and ſo the verie iuſt in iuſtice, in whome they abounde, are liable to damnation, &amp; in eſtate of perdition, as enemies of God, rebells againſt his ſacred maieſtie and Empire.

Rom. 6. 7.</note> doe not rule and reigne in our ſoules, as the holie Apoſtles doe aduiſe vs. But if true; what the Proteſtanter defineth, to witt, that the verie firſt motion of the appetite, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:26602:48"/> the abrupt conſent of will, is deadlie and mortall ſinne, the which none can ſhume or or hinder, what neede is there of any farther painfull labour to reſiſt and withſtand temptation, or the firſt impreſſions? For now allreadie ſinne hath made breache and entrie, now is ſinne raining and raging in the ſoule in number and qualitie infinite, and therein are founde continuall violations of all the tenne commandements, as confeſſeth the Proteſtanter? Neither can our fight abridge this number, in that perpetuallie the violation proceedeth from a corrupted nature day and mighte in all moments; bringing to paſſe alſo, that our verie ſighte and reſiſtance, the withdrawing of conſent from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, be deadlie and mortall ſinnes, and whether we ſtand or fall, abide the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell or yield ſine ſtill, yea mortall ſinne, will preuaile.

I enquire then of this impure Proteſtant, whether in the iuſt or righteous ſinne of concupiſcence doe reigne or no? If he admitt the reigne of concupiſcence, and her empire in them, how then is he obedient to God, ſaying, <hi>Thou shalt not be concupiſcente?</hi> and to the Apoſtle: <hi>Let not concupiſcence reigne in your mortall bodies?</hi> If he deny ſuch reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, let him yield me a reaſon: Is it for that the will conſenteth not to concupiſcence?<note place="margin">Sinne reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

VVhat ment then S Auguſtine and others, in their ſcrupuloſity to crie oute, God forbidd that we ſhould yield conſent to concupiſcence, ſeeing that our holie Proteſtanter a uoucheth a neceſſitie of conſent to concupiſcence, euen in perſons iuſtified, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie thereof as not imputed? Or finallie dooth not concupiſcence reigne, becauſe the iuſt doe not conſent vnto it freelie and deliberatelie?

Then I conclude, that by the doctrine of a Proteſtant, In the verie iuſt reigneth concupiſcence, that is ſinne in all kindes entereth whether man will or no, it defileth the ſoule, whether man will or no, it draweth oute a conſent of ſinne, whether a man will or no, and ſo is abſolute miſtreſſe and commandreſſe of the ſoule. Is not this to reigne, to domineere, to command? It may be that out of his Puritanicall paekerie he will tell me, that concupiſcence reigneth not, althoughe ſinne doe commande in the ſoule by motion and conſent, becauſe throughe a lyuelie faith, in on apprehending God as his God, Chriſt as his Chriſt, all the varletrie<note place="margin">No concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hurt full to a lou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

A ſweete reſolution for a good hogge, and the diuels larderhouſe: ſurelie if the proteſtant vſe no perfumes, none can abide his loth ſome traſhe. Let him now ſoile this argument, if he can: There is no law that forbiddeth the ſodaine motions of concupiſcence before free conſent; neither is there any damage or loſſe to the ſoule by ſuch concupiſcence, or is it poſſible for any man to want the ſame concupiſcence: Therefore neither is there any law forbidding theft or adulterie, there is no damage to the ſoule by theft and adulterie, no poſſitlitie for any perſon to auoyde the ſinnes of theft and aduterie, and ſo a faithfull Proteſtant in a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling libertie, may commit what wickednes he liſteth.

Did not Dauid in his murder and aduoutrie conſent to euill deſires, and obey them? did not alſo S.

Then thus I Diſpute: The iuſt may without loſſe to iuſtice obey euill deſires, and conſent vnto them, and ſo breake the law of God and nature; Therefore according to the Proteſtant, that law of God and nature to the parties ſo offendant was in ſubſtance impoſſible to be kept, and they could doe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.

This hope maketh vs exactly as we can to compoſe and ſquare out our actions according to the rule and meaſure of the law; reputing it an abſurditie to thinke, that God propoſeth to our intelligences a law, or rule of a matter or endeuor impoſſible, or that men are indeede culpable, for not attayning of a thing, or a degree of action, the which to them is not acheuable. But the Proteſtanter, to the end he with his pleaſant faith may clippe from the Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Hope all the haires of fortitude, depriues it of all courage to doe well, or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the law, eſteemeth in generall, the obedience, by the iuſt performed towards the law of God and nature, by two meanes as hath beene rehearſed, to be deficient and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with deadlie ſinne. Firſt in that the very keeping of the law by grace, and as deede of vertue, paſſeth from a facultie of nature corrupted, and being therein ſeated, is ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therby with mortall crime odious to God, and iuſtly derſeruing hell fier: ſo that in this reſpect the law is impoſſible to be obſerued, to wit to the auoydance of mortall ſinne. Moreouer he teacheth, that euerie good worke of the iuſt, or the obedience of<note place="margin">Nothing but ſinne is by the lavv ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> them toward the law, to be ſinnefull, in that it arriueth not to the highte of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and qualitie it oughte, throughte the impediment of a naturall concupiſcence to it adioyned, &amp; therfore the faulte is culpable, hatefull to God, and a verie breache of the law worthy hel fier: althoughe that degree of perfection aſſigned by the law, be to euery one impoſſible. VVhereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the mayntenance of ſinne by Antichriſt, thus may be framed an argument. In the act of vertue, or abſeruance of the law, is included two mortall ſinnes; the one deriued from the corruption of originall ſinne, yet remayning, the other from a defect, in not attayning to that perfection it oughte, and hath in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law: therefore it is better not to worke at all in vertue, or to violate the law, than to keepe and obſerue it. The Antecedent is graunted by the Proteſtanter; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is of like admittance; for in breaking the law, or in not keeping it, is founde one onely ſinne, as for example, that of fornication, adulterie, theft, or of ſuch like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: But in the obſeruance of the law are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted two ſinnes, one of concupiſcence, the other of violating the law, preſcribing a thing impoſſible: therefore it is better not to keepe the law, than to keepe it: in that it is better to committe one ſinne, than two, eſpeciallie when theſe two are deadlie and damnable, as the Proteſtante teacheth, and of equall guilt each of them in ſeuerall with that one.

Auguſtin, by his new decree dooth oblige in conſcience, for that the contrarie fact to this obedience had beene no ſinne, if the prince had not enacted his law. How then true, that no humane law can be commanded vnder paine of ſinne and damnation, as he ſayeth it can not? And if humane law hath ſuch force of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that the law of God is contayned in the law of the Prince, from which all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wre of commandrie is deriued, we agree that Princes lawes bynde in conſcience, in that they can not be tranſgreſſed without ſinne againſt the law diuine. But hereon to impute the whole obligation to God his law, and none to the Princes ſtatute, is follie and ignorance: For althoughe God his law be a generall rule of mens conſciences, yet of them an inward and particular rule is righte reaſon, and it byndeth vnder ſinne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoug he with reſolution of bond in it to God, as author of righte reaſon. So a rule of mens actions, externe and immediate, is the powre in the Prince to make a law for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to draw forth a particular concluſion or determination of matter deduced from generall reaſon, which law of prince is our rule with obligation, althoughe it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie in it as cauſe the prime powre of God, from which the Prince originallie deriued what he hath for the gouernment of others. Then as Princes lawes vnder God are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſo vnder him are they obligations of conſciences, and concluſions or determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of right reaſon: and here on the tranſgreſſion of the Prince his lawe, is a robelling

For Allmightie God as he gouerneth men by reaſon, ſo alſo by powre of ſuperior, by his decree and law. For the determination of reaſon in many things to euerie particular ſubiect is not knowne, before the law of the Prince be enacted, and then reaſon concludeth by conſcience, that is by a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reſolution, that the law is to be obſerued.

The foole in his nett, or in a cadge of glaſſe, thincketh no man to eſpie him with his aſinarie. Dauid a iuſt man committed adulterie, and murder: he had a faith iuſtifying according to the Proteſtantes Theologie: but where was for the time his charitie, where was his chaſtitie, his newneſſe of life, of his ſanctification?

For in that ſinne was committed firſt by act of will, chooſing pleaſure before almightie God, preferring one before the other in loue and affection; ſeeing moreouer that the will is the ſeate and ſubiect of ſinne haroouring the ſame, as a facultie principallie offending, therefore before pardon and juſtification, this will is to be reformed by repentance, by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie loue, and ſo to ſatisfie for the former miſdemeanure, that the ſoule may be iuſtified. VVich mutation of will in a ſinner, the Angellicall Doctor excellentlie well repoſeth in two things, that is, in a departure frow ſinne, and in an approching to God The will then departeth from ſinne, when it griueth at the ſame, when by hatre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then if for remiſſion of ſuch ſinne and iuſtification be neceſſarie repentance, firſt it followeth againſt the Proteſtant, that men are iuſtified by their workes; that is not by onelie faith, but alſo by repentance; when as to exclude iuſtification by workes, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ordinarilie affirmeth onely the worke of faith, and Chriſt his iuſtice to iuſtifie. After hereon may be inferred allſo, that it is a faith altogether falſe and vaine in the Proteſtant, whilſte he beleeueth his ſinne not to be imputed, or that the iuſtice of Chriſt is to him imputed: for in that faith goeth before contrition and repentance, if faith beleeuing the ſinne not to be imputed in that verie moment be not ioyned to iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a falſe faith, ſeeing it beleeueth that, which is not true; that is, that ſinne is not imputed, when in fact it is imputed ſtill, vntill contrition, repentance and charitie be in preſence and haue acceſſe. Then as onely faith dooth not iuſtifie, ſo that eſpeciall faith of a Proteſtant is a falſe faith, and not to be admitted: the which notwithſtanding is the verie life and ſoule of the Proteſtants religion, and the cheefe engine erected vp by Luther and Caluine to impugne the Romane and Catholike be feele. Laſtlie here on doth it enſue, that man is not iuſtified by the iuſtice of Chriſt imputed to him for ſo to that ſhould ſuffice onely faith: but that he is iuſtified after contrition by ſome other qualitie as inherent: for the iuſtice of Chriſt dooth not otherwiſe iuſtifie, as teach the Proteſtanters, but when it is apprehended by one as his owne; which apprehenſion,

And as we attribute this qualitie vntho the Chriſtian faith reclayming vs from offences, ſo alſo aſcribe we to the vertue Charitie that innocencie and puritie, the which can not conſiſt with the enormitie of anie grieuous breache of God his commandement. For holie Scriptures aduertiſe vs, that Charitie maketh friendſhip betwixt God and man, ſo that as one friend in valew and efficacie of frindſhip agreeth to the others deſire, conſpiring as it were in one thoughte, harte, &amp; conuerſation, ſo likewiſe diſſenſion, oppoſition, forſaking of either partie, doth deſtroy and breake ſuch linke of friendſhip and amitie: VVhereupon that perſon, the which is endewed with charitie, as friend with Allmightie God, will for his ſake and loue obſerue his commandements, and in regarde thereof forſake anie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:26602:82"/> pleaſure or emolument, making or inuiting to the contrarie: otherwiſe being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as ſpreaketh our bleſſed Sauiour, yea a lye in ſpirit, to thinke that one loueth God<note place="margin">Iohan. 41.</note> and keepeth not his ordinances. Therefore in the violation of anie of the Ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, as in conſentment to adulterie, fornication, theft, robberie, and the reſt, in which is implyed a preferment of pleaſure before God, a contempt of God, a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſall and breach of his law, appeareth that wickednes and guilt of crime, the which can not abide with charitie, and vnion vnto Allmightie God. In which reſpect the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike iudgement is moſte pure, whereas it hateth ſinne by faith the onely obſtacle againſt charitie, and that which giueth by priuation of the ſame a deadlie blow vnto the ſoule offendant, euen colde againe thereby to death, wanting the vitall heare of that heauenlie vertue. But the Proteſtanter making his charitie as not remoueable from faith, entertayneth therby an abſurde and falſe charitie, an impure charitie, yea a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie affording ſecuritie and innocencie to all treacherie contrarie to God and man. VVherefore againſt the charitie Proteſtantiſh, ſo vnſeparable from faith, I frame this argument: The iuſtifying faith of a Proteſtant is not repugnant to that fact which is a<note place="margin">VVitaker l 3. de pec. or. c. 2.</note> mortall ſinne, and a damnable breache of all the tenne commandements, nor with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it ſelf, in his accounte a ſinne; therefore neither is it aduerſarie and oppoſite to the defect and want of charitie. The Antecedent is made goode by the Proteſtanter,<note place="margin">The Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of Charitie.</note> acknowledging that the iuſt and regenerate tranſgreſſe againſt all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and nature, ſinne continuallie in concupiſcenſce worthie damnation; and affirming the iuſt to haue that charitie, which paſſing by the will of man, as water by a filthie ſincke or channell, is defiled, and a dealie ſinne hatefull to God, and worthie eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fier in hell. The conſequence is thus aſſured. The priuation and want of charitie by euill life, can be no worſe than thoſe ſinnes that ſtand with a iuſtifying faith, and are not imputed to a man in vertue thereof: in that all equallie deſerue eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are indifferentlie in God his ſighte deadlie and mortall ſinnes: Therefore if the crimes of concupiſcence, of charitie it ſelf, do conſiſt with a iuſtifying faith, and by grace thereof are not imputed, or hurte not the offender, ſo alſo may the want of charitie, and expulſion there of by hatred of our neighbour, by murder and rapine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with a iuſtifying faith, and obtayne thereby pardon, remiſſion and forgiuenes. VVhy then can not faith keepe holde in the ſoule withoute charitie, as if the puritie of faith coulde not admitt ſuch a defect? And if faith procure indulgence, and that one mortall ſinne be not imputed, why then to that effect can it not prouide as much for<note place="margin">The faith of a Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tmay be in his ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vvithout moral vertue, and ſo vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Charitie.</note> any treſpaſſe, or for loſſe of charitie? Secondlie thus I diſpute. The iuſtifying faith of a Proteſtant, may abide withoute the morall vertue of iuſtice, of cominencie, of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, therefore alſo may it ſtand in ſequeſtration from charitie towards God and man. The Antecedent is admitted by the Proteſtant, granting to Dauid a iuſtifying faith, in the verie act of adulterie and murder, and to all the regenerate, the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie treſpaſſe againſt the morall vertues by concupiſcence, yea againſt the whole Ten commandements, and are ſometimes blaſphemers, and men plunged in deſpayre. Moreouer reaſon approueth the ſame, ſeeing there is no cauſe, why one ſhould be firſt an infidell diſcrediting the promiſes of Chriſt in his Goſpell, before that by frailtie and heate of nature, he yield conſent vnto luſt vnlawfull; for ſo none ſhould offend againſt temperance and continencie, but infidells, and men that beleeue not in the Goſpell: the which is moſte falſe. The conſequence is thus putt into demonſtration: VVhere is deadlie ſinne oppoſite to charitie towards God, there can no charitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne; as continencie and temperance are not to be founde in perſons impure in dronkennes and riotouſnes: For what agreement betwixt light and darknes, Chriſt<note place="margin">2.

The Catholike admitteth Charitie a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie preparement for iuſtification, the Proteſtant yieldeth no roome thereunto, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to that effect with onelie faith. The Catholike giueth the principalitie to Charitie before all the other vertues: the Proteſtanter will needes aduance faith to that ſuperioritie, contrarie to the Scriptures, and all good intelligence. For althoughe<note place="margin">Faith is a vvor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke of man, as vvel as Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Aug. tra. 25. in in Iohan c 6. Ipſam fidem Apoſtolus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit eſſe opus.</note> he doe equaliſe faith and charitie in this, that both of them be mortall ſinnes; yet for that faith iuſtifieth immediatelie, aſſoileth and ſanctifieth the ſinne of it ſelf, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is remitted by faith, apprehending firſt the iuſtice of Chriſt, faith muſt needes be the cheefe, as moſte ſacred, and neereſt attayning to the iuſtice of Chriſt. Laſt, whereas we make charitie, a gift of the holie Ghoſte, and ſo good, laudable, and heauenlie, the Proteſtanter to hinder mens indeuors from that vertue, will needes perſuade the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that charitie is a mortall ſinne, a mortall ſinne contaminated with originall ſinne: the which, as defineth the Proteſtanter, is a continuall breache of all the tenne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and ſo charitie is guiltie of all the ſinnes poſſible to be committed by ma his frailtie or malice. O heynous ſenſe againſt ſo ſoueraigne a vertue, when as hereby it is manifeſt, that it is better to omitte charitie with one offence, than to bring it forth with ſo manie crimes begrimed and defiled? And dooth God then commande that, or bynde vs to performe that, the which implieth all manner of ſinnes, and is as odious and deteſtable in his ſighte, as is originall ſinne, that is concupiſcence, breaking forth into the ſinnes of the fleſhe and of the ſpirit? Lothing and diſdayne enforceth heere a Period. And that men ſhould not buſie themſelues to obſerue the lawe of Charitie, they be aduertiſed from the Proteſtant, that it is impoſſible, and ſo allwayes deficient and culpable, and thereupon a mortall ſinne, and breache of God his commandement. Doe then Proteſtants, in the verie act of charitie and friendſhip with God, violate the precepts of charitie? VVhat more can doe they who hate God &amp; man? VVhat eſteeme maketh the Proteſtant then of charitie, the princeſſe of the vertues, the origine, ſource, and roote of them, of all goodnes finallie, and integritie of life? Alſo in regard of ciut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie the ſpirit and humour of the Proteſtanter in this reſpect, is harſhe, rude, and full of cruditie. For who knoweth not that Charitie and mutuall loue is that vertue, which principallie cruiliſeth mens manners, that conſerueth ſocietie, louing friendſhip, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandrie and obedience amongſt them?

Then moſte fitlie was a Cherubine, ſo for knowledge ſurnamed, vſed in fire of reuenge, in that it concerned the prouidence of Allmightie God, to take notice of our treſpaſſe, to lay it before our eyes, and balance out the weight thereof with his iudgement of ſeueritie. But now in the time of the Goſpell, when charitie, loue and mercie beare the ſway, haue we a Seraphine glowing hotte with affection to reſolue the worlde into the moiſture of repentance, to exile throughe heate the froſt and coulde of ſinne and infidelitie.

And as a poyſoned liquour once admitted into the ſtomake, after conueyeth contagion by the vitall ſpirits and current of bloud to all members of the bodie, ſo Antichriſt poſſeſſing the Proteſtants mynde with this ſenſe of a iuſtifying faith, thereby empeacheth and ſtriketh to death the whole corps and bulke of Chriſtianitie. In particular, in this onelie faith, apprehending the iuſtice of Chriſt, he repoſeth the grace and compaſſe of the Goſpell, affording no other place to the workes of vertue, as to charitie, to repentance, to teares of greefe and compaſſion, than what may be iudged ſolelie meete for the lawe, and killing letter thereof: which if it be true, why ſhould a Proteſtant beholding Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, exceede the limits and boundes of grace, of the Goſpell, not be content with onelie faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending his righteouſnes, but thereunto adioyne the penaltie, the acerbitie of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we, griefe and gryping pangs of dolour and compaſſion?

Luther well poſſeſſed this ſugred ſenſe of doctrine, and applied his iuſtificatorie faith accordinglie to mirth, to ſecuritie, to ioye, to the delights of a pleaſant conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and refuſed to yield his hart to the law, thereby to be ſtrooken with a penſiue and mournefull contemplation of Chriſt his Paſſion, or to lend thereto his eyes, to beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me fountaynes of brackiſh teares, or his breſt to ſerue for a fornace vamping oute the throbs &amp; ſighes of an aggreeued conſcience.

VVhereupon ſeeing that the iuſtification Proteſtantiſh dooth not exclude ſinne from out the ſoule, it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de how a man then is trulie iuſtified from them?

But this anſwer implieth an abſurditie, and a blaſphemie. Abſurd it is, that God ſhould accept the knowledge of Chriſt for excuſe and expiation of culpable ignorance in an other, for ſo all ſinnes and villanies might by onely faith be pardoned withoute charitie, repentance, amendment, and honeſtie. Then how can a luxurious perſon be accounted iuſt by God throughe the chaſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The blaſphemie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in this, that he compareth iuſtification by the ſacred bloud of Chriſt, to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of a treſpaſſe by the Prince or magiſtrate towards a tranſgreſſor.

So then if man be onely ſo iuſtified, in that God decreeth not to puniſhe an adulterer, well he may free him from paine hereby, yet notwithſtanding in fact is he not iuſt, in that he remayneth actuallie and habituallie a tranſgreſſor, a villaine, a knaue, and well worthie the gallowes. Is then Chriſtian iuſtice in forme of law no better, but a bare immunitie from paine, without all adieyned perfection to the perſon ſo iuſtified, he remayning ſtill in act and habit vniuſt, vngodlie, vnrighteous, onelie deliuered from the rigor of law and paine due to ſuch a tranſgreſſor?

O Chriſt, hath Antichriſt in the Proteſtanter wrought thy iuſtice, the price of thy Croſſe, to this ſhadowe and falſitie! Are Chriſtians iuſtified, bicauſe onelie excuſed from paine or terrour of iudgement, otherwiſe plunged in act and habit in all wickednes: As the Prince dooth iuſtifie ſometimes a knaue remayning in eſtate or act of knauerie?

VVhereupon ſithence that in our Sauiour Chriſt did abounde all manner of actuall vertues and iuſtice, the contrarie vices of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons could not be imputed to him, or he made thereby ſinnefull, odious to God, or worthie of eternall damnation. Then the conſequent is manifeſt, in that the miniſter placed a ſimilitude betwixt the ſinnes of the worlde imputed to Chriſt, and his iuſtice imputed to man; and ſo none are trulie iuſt, trulie gracious to God, trulie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of heauen.

The Antecedent is manifeſt by confeſſion of the aduerſarie, admitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the wole eſſence and nature of originall ſinne to remayne ſtill in the ſoules of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; and by conſequence alſo <hi>reatus paenae</hi> abideth, the guilt of paine; in that as ſinne formallie dooth defile the ſoule by eſſence of it, ſo dooth it make it odious to God, &amp; worthie of eternall fier, the eſſence not altered: and as the proprietie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then ſeeing that originall ſinne neither in eſſence or in internall proprietie is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, it is in no ſort taken away: Yet, ſay they, it may be ſayde to be taken away, in that reſident, it is holden by God not puniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neuertheles the Proteſtanter that thus ſtriueth to mayntaine the empire of ſinne, and of Sathan, in the verie children of God, muſt grant, that in compariſon, notwithſtanding the bloud of Chriſt, ſinne is rather in truthe and deede not taken away, in that it abideth in eſſence and interne proprietie, onely taken away by an externe effect, that is by exemption fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine in hell, ſinne being hindered by the pardon of God, that it worke not morallie ſuch a calamitie. Then in preiudice of Ghriſt his grace originall ſinne is more properlie and truly not taken away, than taken away: Yea I add, not taken away at all. For to<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> hinder a cauſe from working an effect, is not to remoue the cauſe, and take it away; as when God repreſſed the actuall heate of the Babilonian ſurnace, the fier was not taken away: therefore God onely hindering that originall ſinne contriue not effectuallie the burning of any man in hell fier, taketh not away originall ſinne. Then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affirming originall ſinne to be waſhed out and taken away, are either falſe, or the Proteſtanter hereticall. If a Prince ſhould pardon his ſonne or ſubiect, in act of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, ſhould he be ſayd to take away the offence, it during in operation and combuſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? VVel he may hinder that their treſpaſſe bring them not to the blocke, or the gallows, but he can not take their offences away actuallie and eſſentallie inherent and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. How then dooth God take away originall ſinne from the regenerate, whliſte actuallie they committ iniquitie, yea of pride, of infidelitie, of adulterie, and the reſt? well may he hinder the effect which is damnation, but he taketh not ſinne away in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, inheſion, or proprietie: ſuerlie a ſubtill manner of taking away inuented by the Proteſtant, and a plaine iugling tricke, worthie the practiſed of a ſott. But farther I preſſe him; Originall ſinne is neither taken away in eſſence, not in proprietie of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſert, nor in hinderance from working damnation, therefore in no ſort taken away. That the eſſence of originall ſinne is taken away, or the inherence of it from the ſoule, the Proteſtant denyeth: then therefore is it not taken away in proprietie, that is in worthines of it to be puniſhed eternallie: for as the ſinne remayneth formallie, ſo doth it formallie pollute and defile the ſoule: as it doth ſo pollute and defile the ſoule, it maketh it odious and deteſtable to God, that beholdeth the turpitude thereof; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:26602:103"/> he trulie and condignelie iudgeth the ſoule, wherein it is, according to his true and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſt iudgement worthie of hell fier and damnable: vnleſſe the Proteſtant will veile God his eyes, and affirme, that he ſeeth not originall ſinne abyding in the regenerate, nor the formall effect thereof. Hereupon I inferre, that it is blaſphemie in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanter to affirme, that together with this his knowledge, he hindereth ſuch ſinne from effecting damnation, or imputeth it not for ſinne or puniſhable: firſt for that in this ſenſe the verie bloud of Chriſt and his mer it ſhould patroniſe ſinne, encourage men to ſinne; then that he ſhould determine and decree contrarie to his owne iuſtice, the nature of things, and his owne wordes recorded in holie ſcripture.

To deny that they haue, were in anſwer to implie contradiction, and impoſſibilitie; for if they ſticke formallie in the ſoule, to the ſame they impart a formall effect of denomination: as if vpon a wall be formallie inherent whitenes, it formallie maketh and nameth the wall white Then I conclude<note place="margin">Iuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvicked than iuſt by the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> that iuſt perſons are formallie adulteres, theeues, malefactors, odious to God, worthie hell fier.

O full and worthie forgiuenes of ſinnes! Yet thus I vrge the argument: God hateth all iuſt perſons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Proteſtanters, therefore he doth not exempt them from puniſhment. The Antecedent is alredie proued; for if he hate the ſinne, either in act or in habit, as no doubte he doth, ſo alſo as the ſoule formally thereby is hatefull, ſo is it likewiſe hated: that the ſoule is formallie hatefull, is euident; bicauſe that ſubiect in which is formallie an hatefull qualitie, is formallie hatefull: but in the iuſt formally are hatefull qualities, to witt deadlie ſinnes, therefore their ſoules are formallie &amp; in very deede hatefull: then are they either hated of God, or els he dooth not hate all things trulie hatefull, and ſo is there an obiect in the worlde not ſenſed as the thing requireth by Allmightie God; as if there were anie thing intelligible in this worlde, not actuallie knowne by God his intelligence were defectiue, not compriſing all; ſo if in the worlde were an obiect trulie and reallie odible and hatefull, yet not hated by him, his affection were not infinite or complete. And that God doth hate ſuch iuſtified perſons is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer euident, in that if the iuſtice of Chriſt were not imputed to them, in whome ſuch ſinnes are founde, they ſhould be actuallie hated of God; but the iuſtice of Chriſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall dooth not alter the nature and formalitie of ſinne in the ſoule, therefore as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute imputation of Chriſt his iuſtice they were odious to God, and ſuch ſoules as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallie entertayned them, ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Proteſtant will ſay for him, that in theſe children of regeneration inherentlie are founde the ſinnes of adulterie, of extorſion, of rebellion, of impietie; and that thereby ſuch children are adulterers formallie, extortioners, rebells and vngodlie, and ſo conclude that they be children of the deuil his generation. And as for iuſtification to exempt them from his clayme and title, when the Proteſtant telleth the worlde, that they be iuſt onely by the iuſtice of Chriſt in heauen, not iuſt in deede, in forme, or veritie of fact, but in an apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as an ignorant man may be ſayd to be well lettered by the knowledge of Plato, a diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſon in health by the good conſtitution of Apollo, Sathan will crie, all is myne, in that my righte is founded in the things themſelſelues, that is in my ſinnes inſtilled into their ſouls there inherent, and that, vpon which Chriſt ſeemeth to grounde his plea, onelie is externall, it is not indeede, it is not true in realitie of forme, it is fantaſticall, therefore theſe children of regeneration are of my generation, my adulterers, my theeues, my rebells, ſcullions of my blacke guard and retinne. If the miniſter ſo arguing for the diuell, yet greeue to ſubiect himſelf vnto him, or anie of his brethren, let him then with anie reaſon recouer them oute of his clawes if he can: let him anſwer the diuell onely diſputing and vrging vpon his owne foundations and doctrine in matter of faith; vnderſtanding from him, how he with the children of regeneration are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with deadlie ſinne, by an apprehending faith onelie not eſteemed knaues, varlets, impenitents, allthoughe fowle and filthie in ſoule in deede, hated by Almightie God according to his iuſtice, and the nature of the things themſelues.</p>
               <p>8. To conclude, this opinion of the Proteſtanter is far diſtant from Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Impure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Proteſtant.</note> in that it bendeth altogether to impuritie of life, to a licentious libertie, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portfull looſenes, and that by the allowance of the Croſſe of Chriſt. For if anie ſinne in habituall blemiſhe and ſtaine may conſiſt with iuſtice, and by vertue thereof be not imputed, ſo alſo may actuall wickednes what ſoeuer, as hath beene ſayd, abide with the ſame iuſtice in indemnitie not imputed: By which perſuaſion the malice and frailtie of man may aduenture vpon anie abomination, priuiledged and warranted from ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall harme by the Croſſe of Chriſt and his iuſtice; the which to imagine is monſtrous againſt all ciuill honeſtie, and blaſphemous, repugnante to the perfection of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Pure then and heauenlie is the Catholike doctrine, attributing that excellencie to chriſtian iuſtice, the which can not remaine with deadlie ſinne, and contrariwiſe deſcrying that deformitie in ſinne, the which may not allodge together with chriſtian iuſtice and ſanctitie; as hereafter ſhall be more amplie declared.</p>
               <p>VVhen therefore the Pſalmiſt ſayth, that Chriſtian iuſtice couereth mens ſinnes, and<note place="margin">Hovv ſinnes are couered.</note> hideth them, the ſenſe is that they be no more obiects of God his view &amp; intelligence, bicauſe they are not extant: for if they remayned they could not be concealed from the eye of God, as is manifeſt: <hi>VVhen ſinnes are forgiuen,</hi> ſayeth S.

Contrariwiſe according to the reckoning of a Proteſtant, man hath no reaſon to dread the committance of anie ſinne, the purpoſe of anie ſinne, the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate act of anie ſinne; in that actuallie, and that continuallie, he dooth whether he will or no, violate deadlie all the ten commandements, offend in adulterie, infornication, infidelitie, enuie, murder, and that with a ſufficient conſent to a mortall crime. No cauſe therefore is therefor a Proteſtant to feare ſinne, or to retayne a care to auoyde ſinne, in that by will and appetite he dooth ſtill nothing els but deſire, wiſh, purpoſe deadlie ſinnes, repugnant to all the vertues commanded in the decalog. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is of opinion, that for one to be guiltie of adulterie, theft, murder, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie he ſhould freelie conſent vnto ſuch enormities; in that all ſuch offenders haue no free will or ſufficiencie of grace to the contrarie; and ſo is it all one whether they be committed by them in ſleepe, or in time of waking, vpon deliberation or in a paſſion and phrenſie; fn that equallie they were voluntarie and free in the will of Adam: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is then according to him required, that men doe deſire ſuch bad things, and conſent vnto them in appetite of will. Then what neede a faithfull Proteſtant regard much what he dooth or intendeth to compaſſe, in that whether he will or no, he ſhall be adulterous, couetous, vniuſt, incontinent, and a violater of all the tenne commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet ſuch ſinnes are not to be imputed vnto him, or to become hurtfull to his ſoule? For if he ſhould ſay thus with himſelf: Tomorrow I meane to murder ſuch a man, or to kill my ſelf, he ſhall haue no reaſon to thinke himſelf by ſuch proiect and intents deuoide of a iuſtifying faith; in that he mighte repute them trulie onelie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts of concupiſcence, the which concupiſcence in its whole latitude ariuing to the breache of all the commadements, is not imputed vnto him, and he knoweth by faith as muche. So that to ſay that concupiſcence in act is not imputed to anie, is to affirme, that the deſignements of murder o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The maior is thus proued: To purpoſe a good worke, is to purpoſe a deadlie ſinne, to haue in act a good worke is to retaine in act a deadlie ſinne; bnt than a deadlie ſinne in act can not be diuiſed a thing more malignant and contrarie to iuſtice, therefore the qualitie of deadlie ſinne in the purpoſe of murder can not worke greater anoy to iuſtice, than the mortall infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction adioyned to euerie vertue, equallie both being hatefell to God: if then one be not imputed but lawfull and not hurtfull, neither is the other to be imputed, to become damageable or diſtreſſefull: rather it is to be ſupped vp by a liuelie faith, and ſo not imputed.

To a beleeuing Proteſtant is not imputed a mortall ſinne in act, whilſte he dooth well, not is ſuch good worke being materially a mortall ſinne hurtfull vn to him therefore neither is adulterie, rebellion, impietie, or anie wickednes in act imputed vnto him, or hurtfull to his ſweete goſpelling and puritanicall ſoule: Equallie there is offence on both ſides, and a moratll ſinne. The cauſe is, for the will produceth them with the ſame neceſſitie, in that according to the Proteſtanter he that committeth adulterie dooth it of neceſſitie, and ſo no difference may ariſe, for that the contagion of a mortall ſinne proceedeth from nature to a good worke of natures neceſſitie: The ſinne adhearing to a good worke is the ſinne of a concupiſcence; and adulterie is but a tricke of concupiſcence, whilſte faith ſtandeth aloft to ſhield ſinns from anoye, to conceale them from God his ſighte.

VVhereupon I frame this argument: All the good workes of men preſcribed by God and nature are mortall ſinnes, therefore we are bounde to committ mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yea God and nature are principall authors, inducers and perſuaders to ſinnes. The antecedent they grant as good, and denie the conſequent or illation vpon a diſtinction, ſaying the law of God and nature onelie to binde to the good act in as much as good, and not to the ſame as bad and defiled by originall ſinne, in that ſinne <hi>is not implied in the dutie, but ariſeth by caſuall and accidentall neceſsitie from the condition of the man.</hi> Firſt who euer heard of a caſuall and accidentall neceſſitie in anie worke of man, of which drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſlight braynes of a miniſter? If it be impoſſible that otherwiſe it ſhould fall oute, or that the act of vertue ſhould not be ſinnefull, as now it is, ſuppoſing the ſinne of Adam, how then is the dutie thereof to God caſuallie and accidentallie polluted with ſinne, being impoſſible, that concupiſcence now ſhould not be in man, in that by nature all men, as ſayeth the Apoſtle, not by chance or accident, are borne the children<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> of wrath? O the caſualtie of ſinne in an act naught and corrupted by the law of nature, and not to be altered by anie man his endeuor what ſoeuer! Yea that the good workes of men are ſtayned with ſinne according to the Proteſtants owne principles is more neceſſarie and leſſe euitable, than that the act of murder is a ſinne, or adulterie, taking the act in the materialitie: that is, it is more impoſſible that a vertue according to the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:26602:112"/> materiall part thereof ſhould not be ſtayned with mortall ſinne, than that the materiall act of murder and adulterie ſhould be freed from ſuch blot of deadlie offence. I frame then this argument to trouble the ſillie ſophiſtrie of the miniſter. Man is bound by God and nature to performe that act, which is neceſſarilie in the higheſt degree ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, therefore he is bounde to ſinne, and to that ſinne of which God and nature are principall cauſers and authors. The antecdeent is thus auerred. There be two cauſes of ſinne, to which ſinne is imputed, the one is the phyſicall cauſe, as the will of man or angell that ſinneth, the other the morall, as he is, that perſuadeth ſinne to an other by bad counſell or worde; &amp; that theſe two maner of agents doe ſinne is not required an<note place="margin">Sinne is not purpoſed as ſinne.</note> expreſſe intention to ſinne directlie with will of ſinne; for no man ſo offendeth. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he that committeth adulterie, doth not formallie and directlie intend to ſinne, yea he wiſheth rather that ſuch a voluptuous act were no ſinne: neuertheles he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, bicauſe that ſuch an act with all circumſtances adioyned, is ſinne, and that of neceſſitie. Alſo one that counſelleth an other to forſweare himſelf for his owne lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, dooth not purpoſe directlie the ſinne of petiurie, but onelie the outward act, yet ſinneth, for that ſuch an act inueſted with thoſe circumſtances can not be otherwiſe than ſinnefull. Therefore if man be bounde and obliged to committ that act, as the Proteſtant anoucheth, which is of neceſſitie ſinnefull, he is bounde to ſinne: and ſo if men be obliged to be vertuous, if the act of vertue of neceſſitie be contaminated with ſinne, and this thing be foreſeene before the act, man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s bounde to ſinne; yea after a ſtraighter maner of obligation throughe neceſſitie, than he is in the caſe of adulterie and periurie: for that ſubſtantiall act which now is adulterous, is ſo meerlie caſuallie and accidentallie, bicauſe the partie with whome the ſinne is committed might in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane moralitie and occurrence of things, be the other parties wife or huſband, and ſo the fact is by chance onelie ſinnefull: ſo alſo the act of periurie might be lawfull, alter onelie the matter, which may fall oute all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o no naturall poſſibilitie in the meane ſeaſon infringed. But that anie act of mans ſoule ſhould not be a deadlie ſinne, is altogether impoſſible according to the Proteſtants grounds, and it can not otherwiſe be by anie humane action or euent, ſeeing that onelie Adams ſinne ſuppoſed, and nature corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby, by extremitie of neceſſitie all endeuors of men are polluted therewith, as with a ſtaine of a mortall ſinne; therefore obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vertue is a more forceable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat<note place="margin">Bonde to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is founde in all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proteſtant.</note> on to ſinne, than is the obligation to adulterie, murder, or periurie: bicauſe theſe acts may be good and lawfull, according to humane policie and euents, as to vſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarlie the partie to one eſpouſed, to kill by publike authoritie, or for defence of a man his owne life, to ſweare a truthe: VVhere as by no humane chance it can fall oute, that, vertue be not polluted with ſtaine of a mortall ſinne. Let the miniſter ſuppoſe one to be bounde in conſcience, or els to purpoſe to kill or to ſteale: Then I demand of him, whether in this ſuppoſall there were not an obligation to ſinne, and an intent of ſinne or no. If he anſwer it were: Then I aske the reaſon: and he will tell me if he haue anie witt, for that ſuch acts are neceſſarilie conioyned to the formalitie of ſinne, the which of neceſſitie will adhere to the act of the will, as ſoone as it is produced. But then I will inferre, that if a vertuous act be a mortall ſinne of greater neceſſitie, than is the act of adulterie or murder, as hath beene proued; then ſhould there be in the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vertue, an obligation to ſinne, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The conſequent conſiſted on two parts; the firſt that men ſhould be obliged to ſinne by God and nature, the which is allreadie proued, the other implied that God &amp; nature ſhould be principall authors and cauſes of ſinne: The which thus I maynteine as good and as a iuſt inference. God and nature perſuade and induce men to that act
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:26602:113"/> which of extreme neceſſitie is a mortall ſinne, therefore they are cauſes of mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. The Antecedent is admitted by the Proteſtant, but he denieth the conſequence vpon a diſtinction, in that God and nature doe not perſuade anie act as ſinnefull, but onelie as good and lawfull. Nothithſtanding, this diſtinction, for the deniall of the conſequent, is inſufficient, yea childiſh, and friuolous. For example, if one ſhould ſitt downe vpon a ſtoole vncleane, althoughe he intended onelie his eaſe, yet knowing the euent, ſhould be cauſe of the defyling of his apparrell, as is euident, for that ſuch an euent is foreſeene as naturallie and neceſſarilie following on the act intended: ſo likewiſe if one ſhould perſuade an other, with the like knowledge the ſame ſitting, he alſo ſhould be cauſe of the ſame bad ſucceſſe, althoughe he purpoſed directlie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſlie<note place="margin">Induceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to vertue are induceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to ſinne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> no ſuch thing: Euen ſo God and nature, if they excite men to actions neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie made euill, as the immediate naturall and neceſſarie cauſe of ſinne, they are alſo cauſes of ſinne, althoughe not directlie in forme, yet in a mediation of cauſe; in that an effect may becauſed in an immediate action arriuing to the effect it ſelf, and alſo attayning onelie to the cauſe thereof naturallie and neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lie thereon enſuing: for example, he that is cauſe of his owne dronkennes dooth not expreſſlie deſire or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie procure drunkennes, but onelie is cauſe thereof in drinking toe much, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon dronkennes is a neceſſarie conſequent: In like ſort if God and nature produce in man anie action, althoughe otherwiſe good, yet if that action produced be the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and naturall cauſe of ſinne, they ſhall be deemed as cauſers and prouokers of ſinne. But according to the Proteſtanter this good action or worke, in as much, as an effect of nature in man corrupted, and made vicious, dooth neceſſarilie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>plie the efficient and materiall cauſe of ſinne; that is, ſinne is a neceſſarie effect of that power and act in man preſcribed by God and nature, therefore to perſuade and will ſuch an act, is to perſuade and command ſinne. The cauſe is otherwiſe in the infuſion of a ſoule into a bodie propagated from Adam in reſpect of originall ſinne, in that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe of ſinne is not the information of the bodie by the ſoule, althoughe the ſame be required as a condition to contract originall ſinne, but the common free choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the will in Adam. But heere is a diſpute not aboute habituall ſinne, but actuall and perſonall, and therefore God muſt be author of it, if in the perſon offending be a neceſſitie of ſinne, eſpeciallie if Adam allſo offended by neceſſitie, as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant teacheth. No meruaile then if ſinne hurt not a Proteſtant, or that he neede to be afrighted to committ ſinne, when he induceth God and nature as authors of his ſinne, and ſinne is not imputed by reaſon of a faith apprehending the iuſtice of Chriſt.</p>

Neither would I that long it ſhould ſtick in the queſie and weake ſtomake of the Proteſtanter, as a thinge harſh and crude, that we auouch of meritt, as if it were repugnant to ſuch places of ſcriptures, which call heauenlie ſaluation a grace and free gifte of God, enforming vs, that by grace we are ſaued, and not by our owne ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. For to cleare this matter in his eye, and to digeſt it in his affection, is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onlie a littell witt, and a penney worth of learning. It hath been told him of the Councell of Auroſicum, out of S Auguſtin, and S.

Otherwiſe if compariſon be made betwixt the worcke and that ſtipend the worcke well and fullie deſerueth by valew in it from grace, and motion of the holie ghoſte: alſo the ſtipend is ſutable to the worcke, as due vnto it with a certaine proportion of equiualencie, and iuſtice of remuneration. <hi>Euerie one</hi> ſayeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>shall receiue revvarde according to his labour.</hi> Then is labour the cauſe of the rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and thus much labour of thus much rewarde: and in meaſure reſpecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yf Chriſt be reddy to yeelde eare vnto our praiers, why doe we direct our deuotions from ſo fauorable a lorde? And if truſt and repoſe in him be abondant for our ſaluation, to what purpoſe make we an addition of the Sainctes interceſſions, as ſupplie for the want in the merites of Chriſt our Redemer?

               <p>7. Secondlie I proceede in this argument. It is not anie diminiſhinge of Chriſt his mediation and propitiation that one man aliue pray for an other, or that one pray to a Sainte aliue to pray for him, therfore nether is it diſgracefull to our ſauiour Chriſt to pray to the ſaintes in heauen for helpe and beneuolence. That one man is to pray for an other in this life, approueth the Apoſtle, <hi>I beſeeche yovv, let there be made prayers obſecrations, thankes geuinge, for all men.</hi> And the holie Apoſtle himſelfe aduenturinge vpon the dangerous pickes, he expected at Rome, deſired inſtantlie to be aſſiſted and holpen with the prayers of his bretheren, ſaintes, and his owne deuout children. In which caſe one man in a certaine manner is mediator for an other, that is a meanes &amp; cauſe of ſome ſpirituall good through Chriſt Ieſus. For if ſuch commoditie were not the effect of their prayers, to what purpoſe ſhould one deſire the prayers of an other? Yet neuertheleſſe the holie Apoſtle expreſſelie telleth vs, that the interceſſion of one brother for an other, and that in the ſame kinde, the mediation of one for an other, is in no wiſe oppoſit to the maine and capitall mediation by our ſauiour Chriſt: conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his exhortation to mutuall prayers with theſe wordes, <hi>For there is one God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> the reaſon is before rehearſed, in that the prayers of the liuing floe from the merittes of Chriſt, and are effectes of the ſame, workeinge in vertue therof, Then alſo is it euident, that our prayers directed to the ſaintes in heauen are not iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe to our ſauiour Chriſt, no more then on earth the prayers of S. Stephen were, vttred for ſaint Paule his conuerſion. VVhat difference, I pray yow, may make a diſparitie, and hinder the conſequence? Is it perhaps difference of place? But how can onelie place procure that a prayer derogate from Chriſt here, and not there, onlie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of place conſidered? Is it not all one whether the Sainte, to whem we pray, be in London, in Rome, or in Hieruſalem, or in heauen, as concerning the iniurie enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon Chriſt? Is heauen ſo odious to a Proteſtant, or ſo out of requeſt with Chriſt, that it onelie ſhall diſgrace and auile the prayer, the which in earth was by God repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as good and well pleaſinge, pious, and meritorious? o the great aſinarie of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainie, and of the illuminated drols? or els for diſparitie will they aledge, that the ſaintes in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are glorified, &amp; not ſo the mortall ſaintes on earth, &amp; therfore to pray to Saintes in heauen is extremely malicious againſt the croſſe, &amp; flat idolatrie.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:26602:138"/> the Saintes, and not by Chriſte. A pitifull complainte, able certes to make one grone againe, if it were not for leaping. I wold to God the Proteſtant wold looke to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by his wittes, &amp; then he wold ſoone ſee how we hope to be ſaued by the Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Good Sir, when yow pray to a brother or a ſiſter of yours aliue, or to the aged worſhipfull of the congregation, to intercede for yow to God, as that he will by their prayers ſhelde yow from temptations, preſerue yow from ſinne, finallie ſaue your ſoule, if percaſe theſe petitions be in your memoriall, when yow pray, doe not yow expect ſaluation from theſe your ſaintes, and this your brotherhoode? Then in your deuotion what is become of Chriſt Ieſus? Yf he be ſufficient &amp; aboundant for all theſe graces, why pray yow to anie of the congregation, why read yow the bible, why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue yow anie ſacrament, why heare yow a ſermon, vnleſſe yow make theſe media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors alſo betwixt God and yow? Then we by our prayers to the ſaintes doe not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or deny redemption by Chriſt, for whoſe ſake, we acknowledge the prayers of them to be for vs available.</p>
               <p>8. Laſtly, thus I argue: although mediation by our Sauiour Chriſt be moſt aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant<note place="margin">Saintes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to applie the merits of Chriſt vnto vs.</note> and ouer flowing, yet the ſame is applied vnto vs as healthfull and of ſaluation, by ſondry meanes and inſtrumentes mediatinge betwixt our ſoules and his deſerts, as by peruſing of the written word, hearinge of learned and vertuouſe ſpeeches, follouing good exhortations, allſo by the freqent vſe of the ſacramentes: all which interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding meanes of our ſaluation as they doe not diſalow or iniurie the merittes of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſo no more doe the prayers &amp; gratiouſe ſuffrages of the ſaintes anie thinge tende to that bade effect: therfore to pray to the ſaintes, or to expect ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their prayers, is no iniurie againſt the croſſe or meritt of Chriſte. VVho can deny, but that in a certaine ſenſe one may pronounce that he is to be ſaued by baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, by the holie Evchariſt, and readinge the ſcriptures, by good exhortations and examples of others, as to become thereby penitent, &amp; ſo to be ſaued, yet without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paringe mediation by Chriſt, becauſe theſe ſacramentes, theſe ſcriptures, theſe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations worke in the efficacie of Chriſt his merits, and are the effectes of the price and deſert of him, his bloode worckeing our ſaluation in ſuch ſacramentes, in wordes, examples &amp; exhortations? Knowen it is, that onelie the diuinitie is the originall chiefe and prime cauſe of our ſaluation: yet notwithſtandinge the humanitie of Chriſt, his bodie and ſoule, and will, and that without miſpriſion to the diuinitie, alſo are cauſes of our ſaluation, in that ſuch humanitie is an inſtrument of the diuinitie, ſanctified therby, and intercedeth betwixt the diuinitie and out treſpaſſes. The thirde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the holie Ghoſt by apropriation is reputed author of inſpired charitie, of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, of repentance, and the like, yet without empeachement to the ſecond, to the humanitie of Chriſt, his croſſe, or his water in baptiſme, in that from the merites of Chriſt haue we that aſſiſtance and operation from the holy Ghoſt.

To conclude then in charitie towardes the Chriſtian reader, and to ſhutt vp the row partes of this Triall entreatinge of faith and hope, for thy better inſtruction therby, I beſeeche thee onelie obſerue this animaduerſion: to wit, that ſithens the nature of men through the fall of Adam, and otherwiſe, is weakened in all faculties for the workeinge accordinge to reaſon, vertue and ciuilitie, and is ſtrongly enclined to ſenſualitie, to vnſeemelie pleaſures, and finallie tendeth of it ſelfe to diſorder and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme, thou muſt knowe, that relligion to be beſte, and to be atcepted of the, the which for vertue, for reaſon, for ciuilitie, geueth the more efficacious forces of aide and aſſiſtance, calling back as it were the motion &amp; bende of this our deprauation. In regarde wherof, we with great probabilitie argue againſt the pagan for the truth of Chriſtianitie, in that our bleſſed ſauiour, by his holie faith, confortable hope, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſe charitie, and heauenlie relligion, ſtandeth before all other reformers for the abetterance of nature, and reclaimeing of it to vertue and ciuilitie. VVherevpon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie balance by thy owne thoughtes, I beſeeche the, whether the Catholick yeldeth to natures weakenes, ignorances, and calamities, better meanes to liue according to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ciuilitie, then the Proteſtant can aforde, or no: and then ſhalt thou ſee, that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:26602:139"/> whereas the faith catholick relyinge on the outward aucthoritie of the church is a in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious faith, a faith of certaintie, of veritie, of puritie, contrariewiſe perceiue the faith Proteſtantiſh eſtranged from aucthoritie, to be deuoide of prudence, of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of vnitie, of certaintie, of integritie: finally no faith at all, but a deuiſed machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Antichriſt, coloured with the name of faith, to batter and deſtroy the Chriſtian faith in ſubſtance and ſaueing life therof.

And wheras theſe later yeres of noueltie and change in the miſteries of heauen, haue wrought a great decay of Chriſtian faith in this our kingdome; ſo haue they disforniſhed nature of many helpes for vertue, &amp; made ſtrong, euenthrough out, the empire of ſinne; of euil cuſtomes, and ſo of barbariſme, the vglie and monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bratt of ſuch deformed parentes.
